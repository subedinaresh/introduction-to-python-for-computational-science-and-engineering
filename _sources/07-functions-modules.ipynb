    "Functions allow us to group a number of statements into a logical block. We communicate with a function through a clearly defined interface, providing certain parameters to the function, and receiving some information back. Apart from this interface, we generally do not how exactly a function does the work to obtain the value it returns\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the function `math.sqrt`: we do not know how exactly it computes the square root, but we know about the interface: if we pass *x* into the function, it will return (an approximation of) $\\sqrt{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This abstraction is a useful thing: it is a common technique in engineering to break down a system into smaller (black-box) components that all work together through well defined interfaces, but which do not need to know about the internal realisations of each other’s functionality. In fact, not having to care about these implementation details can help to have a clearer view of the system composed of many of these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions provide the basic building blocks of functionality in larger programs (and computer simulations), and help to control the inherent complexity of the process.\n",

    "The word “function” has different meanings in mathematics and programming. In programming it refers to a named sequence of operations that perform a computation. For example, the function `sqrt()` which is defined in the `math` module computes the square root of a given value:"

IPython does not provide an editor, but you can carry on using the IDLE editor to edit files, or any other editor you like.\n",

Ipython will now show all the possible commands (and variable names) that start with <span>`ra`</span>. If you type a third letter, here <span>`n`</span> and press “Tab” again, Ipython will auto complete and append <span>`ge`</span> automatically.\n",

    "   Note that this differs from executing a python program in IDLE: IDLE restarts the Python interpreter session and thus deletes all existing objects before the execution starts. This is not the case with the <span>`run`</span> command in ipython (and neither when executing chunks of Python code from Emacs using the Emacs Python mode). In particular this can be very useful if one needs to setup a few objects which are needed to test the code one is working on. Using ipython’s <span>`run`</span> or Emacs instead of IDLE allows to keep these objects in the interpreter session and to only update the function/classes/... etc that are being developed.\n",

See <https://www.spyder-ide.org/> for more.\n",

    "\n",
    "All major editors that are used for programming, provide Python modes (such as Emacs, Vim, Sublime Text), some Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs) come with their own editor (Spyder, Eclipse). Which of these is best, is partly a matter of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, Spyder seems a sensible choice as it provides an IDE, allows execution of chunks of code in an interpreter session and is easy to pick up."

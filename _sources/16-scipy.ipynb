    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The core Python language (including the standard libraries) provide enough functionality to carry out computational research tasks. However, there are dedicated (third-party) Python libraries that provide extended functionality which\n",
    "\n",
    "-   provide numerical tools for frequently occurring tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "-   which are convenient to use\n",
    "\n",
    "-   and are more efficient in terms of CPU time and memory requirements than using the code Python functionality alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We list three such modules in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `numpy` module provides a data type specialised for “number crunching” of vectors and matrices (this is the `array` type provided by “`numpy`” as introduced in [14-numpy.ipynb](14-numpy.ipynb)), and linear algebra tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `matplotlib` package (also knows as `pylab`) provides plotting and visualisation capabilities (see [15-visualising-data.ipynb](15-visualising-data.ipynb)) and the\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `scipy` package (SCIentific PYthon) which provides a multitude of numerical algorithms and which is introduced in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the numerical algorithms available through `scipy` and `numpy` are provided by established compiled libraries which are often written in Fortran or C. They will thus execute much faster than pure Python code (which is interpreted). As a rule of thumb, we expect compiled code to be two orders of magnitude faster than pure Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the help function for each numerical method to find out more about the source of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SciPy\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scipy` provides many scientific computing functions and is generally complementary to the the functionality of `numpy`. "

    "Often we need to find the maximum or minimum of a particular function *f*(*x*) where *f* is a scalar function but *x* could be a vector. Typical applications are the minimisation of entities such as cost, risk and error, or the maximisation of productivity, efficiency and profit. Optimisation routines typically provide a method to minimise a given function: if we need to maximise *f*(*x*) we create a new function *g*(*x*) that reverses the sign of *f*, i.e. *g*(*x*)= − *f*(*x*) and we minimise *g*(*x*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide an example showing (i) the definition of the test function and (ii) the call of the `scipy.optimize.fmin` function which takes as argument a function *f* to minimise and an initial value *x*<sub>0</sub> from which to start the search for the minimum, and which returns the value of *x* for which *f*(*x*) is (locally) minimised. Typically, the search for the minimum is a local search, i.e. the algorithm follows the local gradient. We repeat the search for the minimum for two values (*x*<sub>0</sub> = 1.0 and *x*<sub>0</sub> = 2.0, respectively) to demonstrate that depending on the starting value we may find different minimar of the function *f*.\n",
